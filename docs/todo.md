# Todo
Allow watch for new commits ( need to modify my parsing of git diff? )

Form for authentication -- paths to ssh keys and all that 

Make so updates only render diif of files specifically, not all files at once to save on efficiency

# Notes
Have the ability to see tags and view history and navigate it through.

define configurations --take snapshot names (tag a group of files) anbd be able to retrieve files that are broken
create snap shots, difference between snapshot, see file and see difference between files
Difference between files -- qs structure of file? 
See meta data about check in times and different between files (compare 2 files history

# Notes

* white list I want these files to go out/ not go out white/blacklist 
    * limit files by size
        * RESULTS: Can blacklist and whitelist via GITIGNORE -- we can chose to blacklist everything and let some things through -- or vice versa. Becomes annoying, good convention is blacklist ONLY what is unnecessary, whether that be paths or otherwise
